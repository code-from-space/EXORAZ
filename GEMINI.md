# Project: Exoraz Personal Portfolio

## Directory Overview

This directory contains the source code for a personal portfolio website. It's a static, single-page website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Key Files

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
*   `style.css`: The stylesheet for the website, including a dark theme, animations, and responsive design.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity to the website, including a morphing tile effect, a spotlight that follows the mouse, interactive character eyes, and a typewriter effect.
*   `images/`: A directory containing images used in the website.

## How to Run

This is a static website. To run it, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Development Conventions

The project uses a clean and modern coding style. The CSS is well-structured with variables for colors and a clear separation of concerns. The JavaScript is also well-organized, with separate functions for each of the main interactive features.
